# Chat Journal

This project contains exported ChatGPT conversations organized into a small journal.

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to browse topics. Each topic page loads the
relevant conversation, displays an image for the topic and provides Previous and
Next buttons for quick navigation. Notes you add are stored locally in your
browser.
