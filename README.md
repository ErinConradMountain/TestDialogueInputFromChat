# Chat Topics

Each conversation from ChatGPT is presented as a standalone web page. Open one
of the `docs/topicX.html` files directly in your browser to read the discussion
and see the related image.

Every page is independent and does not link to other topics.

# Chat Journal

This project contains exported ChatGPT conversations organised into a small journal.

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to browse topics. Each topic page loads the relevant conversation, displays an image for the topic and provides Previous and Next buttons for quick navigation. Notes you add are stored locally in your browser.

# Digital Journal

This project contains exported conversations and images, presented through a simple web interface.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the journal entries and photos. The entry titles are loaded from `entries.json` and the images are displayed from the relevant directory.
